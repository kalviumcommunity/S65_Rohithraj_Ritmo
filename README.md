![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)

## Description
Ritmo is an AI-powered tool that curates personalized music playlists based on user preferences (e.g., mood, genre, or occasion like "chill jazz for studying"). Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it retrieves song metadata from datasets like Kaggle’s Spotify dataset and prompts a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate tailored playlists with descriptions. Built with Python, LangChain, Sentence-Transformers, Chroma, and Streamlit, Ritmo supports interactive playlist refinement.

## Features
- **Personalized Playlists**: Generates playlists based on mood, genre, or occasion.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines vector-based retrieval with LLM generation for accurate recommendations.
- **Prompting Techniques**: Zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, dynamic, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.
- **Evaluation**: Automated pipeline with 5+ test cases to ensure relevance and coherence.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and traffic with Chroma and cloud-ready design.

## Usage
1. Launch the Streamlit UI.
2. Enter preferences (e.g., "workout rock playlist").
3. View JSON playlist (`playlist_name`, `songs`, `description`).
4. Refine by mood, genre, or occasion.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Python, LangChain (RAG), OpenAI API (LLM), Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), Chroma (vector DB), Streamlit (UI).
- **Dataset**: Kaggle’s Spotify dataset (title, artist, genre, lyrics).
- **Pipeline**:
  1. Load and preprocess song metadata into text chunks.
  2. Generate embeddings with Sentence-Transformers.
  3. Index embeddings in Chroma for fast similarity search.
  4. Embed user query, retrieve top-5 songs, generate JSON playlist via LLM.
  5. Configure LLM: `temperature=0.8` (creativity), `top_p=0.9` (diversity), `top_k=50` (coherence), `stop=["</playlist>"]` (conciseness), JSON output.
  6. Use Spotify API for additional metadata via function calling.
  7. Evaluate with 5+ test cases (query, expected playlist); score relevance and coherence.
  8. Compare cosine, L2, and dot product similarities for retrieval accuracy via PRs.

## System Prompt
You are Ritmo, an AI playlist curator. Generate personalized playlists based on user preferences (mood, genre, occasion) using retrieved song metadata (title, artist, genre, lyrics). Output a JSON playlist with `playlist_name`, `songs` (5 song objects with `title`, `artist`, `genre`), and `description`. Use `temperature=0.8`, `top_p=0.9`, `top_k=50`. Stop at `</playlist>`. Output valid JSON.

## User Prompt
Create a JSON playlist for "chill jazz for studying" with 5 songs from provided metadata. Include `playlist_name`, `songs` (title, artist, genre), and `description`.

## RTFC Framework Explanation
- **Role**: System defines Ritmo as an AI playlist curator.
- **Task**: System instructs generating playlists with metadata; user specifies "chill jazz for studying" playlist.
- **Format**: Both require valid JSON with `playlist_name`, `songs`, `description`.
- **Constraints**: 5 songs, creative parameters (`temperature=0.8`, etc.), stop at `</playlist>`, user theme-specific.

## Zero-Shot Prompting Explanation
**What is Zero-Shot Prompting?**  
Zero-shot prompting is a technique where the AI generates a response based solely on instructions without prior examples or training data for the specific task. The model relies on its pre-trained knowledge and prompt clarity to produce accurate outputs.

**How It’s Utilized**  
- **System Prompt**: Defines Ritmo’s role and task, instructing it to generate a playlist using metadata without examples. It specifies JSON structure, 5 songs, and LLM parameters (`temperature=0.8`, etc.) for zero-shot flexibility.  
- **User Prompt**: Requests a "chill jazz for studying" playlist, relying on the model’s ability to interpret the theme and metadata without examples.  
The zero-shot approach allows Ritmo to handle diverse inputs flexibly, leveraging the LLM’s generalization and the RAG pipeline’s metadata retrieval.

## One-Shot Prompting Explanation
**What is One-Shot Prompting?**  
One-shot prompting is a technique where the AI is provided with a single example to guide its response, helping it understand the desired output format and style without extensive training data.

**How It’s Utilized**  
- **System Prompt**: Defines Ritmo’s role and tasks it with generating a JSON playlist using metadata, specifying structure and parameters (`temperature=0.8`, etc.). It includes one example for "upbeat pop for a road trip" to show JSON format, 5 songs, and description style.  
- **User Prompt**: Requests a "relaxing acoustic for a cozy evening" playlist, following the example’s structure and style for consistency.  
This leverages the example to anchor the response while allowing flexibility, using the RAG pipeline for song selection.

## Multi-Shot Prompting Explanation

Include `playlist_name`, `songs` (title, artist, genre), and a `description` reflecting the query’s vibe, adapting to the query’s specific details (genre, era, occasion) as shown in the examples.

**Dynamic Prompting Explanation**  
**What is Dynamic Prompting?**  
Dynamic prompting adapts the AI’s response based on the user’s input complexity, using conditional logic or examples to tailor output depth and detail, handling both simple and complex queries effectively.

**How It’s Utilized**  
- **System Prompt**: Instructs Ritmo to create a JSON playlist, using dynamic prompting to adjust based on query complexity. Simple queries (e.g., "happy pop") get a basic playlist; detailed queries (e.g., with era or occasion) incorporate specifics. Two examples illustrate this: one simple ("happy pop") and one detailed ("fast-paced 80s rock for a party"). Parameters like `temperature=0.8` ensure creativity.  
- **User Prompt**: Requests a "mellow indie folk from the 2010s for a rainy day" playlist, a detailed query. The model adapts by selecting relevant songs and crafting a specific description, following the detailed example’s style, with the RAG pipeline ensuring metadata-driven selection.  
This ensures flexible handling of varied query complexity.

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting Explanation
**System Prompt**  
You are Ritmo, an AI music playlist curator. Create personalized playlists based on user preferences (e.g., mood, genre, occasion) using song metadata (title, artist, genre, lyrics) from a vector database. Use chain-of-thought prompting to reason through the process: (1) Analyze the user’s query to identify mood, genre, and occasion; (2) Select 5 songs from metadata that match the query’s criteria, ensuring variety; (3) Craft a playlist name and description reflecting the query’s vibe. Output a JSON playlist with `playlist_name`, `songs` (5 song objects with `title`, `artist`, `genre`), and a `description`. Set `temperature=0.8`, `top_p=0.9`, `top_k=50`. Stop at `</playlist>`. Output valid JSON.

**Example**:
For query "upbeat pop for a road trip":
- Step 1: Query specifies "upbeat pop" (mood: energetic, genre: pop) and "road trip" (occasion: fun, driving).
- Step 2: Select 5 pop songs with high energy from metadata, ensuring diverse artists.
- Step 3: Name the playlist "Road Trip Jams" and describe it as energetic and sing-along-friendly.
```json
{
  "playlist_name": "Road Trip Jams",

    {"title": "Uptown Funk", "artist": "Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars", "genre": "Pop"},
    {"title": "Good Time", "artist": "Owl City & Carly Rae Jepsen", "genre": "Pop"},
    {"title": "Shut Up and Dance", "artist": "Walk the Moon", "genre": "Pop"},
    {"title": "Can't Stop the Feeling!", "artist": "Justin Timberlake", "genre": "Pop"}
  ],
  "description": "An energetic pop playlist to keep you singing along on your road trip adventure."
}
</playlist>
```

**User Prompt**  
Generate a JSON playlist for "mellow indie folk from the 2010s for a rainy day" with 5 songs from provided metadata. Include `playlist_name`, `songs` (title, artist, genre), and a `description` reflecting the query’s vibe. Use chain-of-thought prompting to reason through: (1) Analyze the query’s mood, genre, and occasion; (2) Select 5 matching songs with variety; (3) Create a playlist name and description.

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting Explanation**  
**What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?**  
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where the AI is instructed to break down a task into logical steps, reasoning through each to arrive at a solution. This improves transparency and accuracy for complex tasks.

**How It’s Utilized**  
- **System Prompt**: Instructs Ritmo to use CoT by explicitly outlining three steps: (1) Analyze the query for mood, genre, and occasion; (2) Select 5 diverse songs from metadata; (3) Craft a playlist name and description. Parameters (`temperature=0.8`, etc.) ensure creativity, and an example illustrates the reasoning process for "upbeat pop for a road trip."  
- **User Prompt**: Requests a "mellow indie folk from the 2010s for a rainy day" playlist, instructing the model to follow the CoT steps to analyze the query, select songs, and create a name and description. The RAG pipeline ensures metadata-driven song selection.  
This approach enhances the model’s reasoning, ensuring precise and contextually relevant playlists.
