# Ritmo-Playlists

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)

## Description
Ritmo is an AI-powered tool that curates personalized music playlists based on user preferences (e.g., mood, genre, or occasion like "chill jazz for studying"). Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it retrieves song metadata from datasets like Kaggle’s Spotify dataset and prompts a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate tailored playlists with descriptions. Built with Python, LangChain, Sentence-Transformers, Chroma, and Streamlit, Ritmo supports interactive playlist refinement.

## Features
- **Personalized Playlists**: Generates playlists based on mood, genre, or occasion.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines vector-based retrieval with LLM generation for accurate recommendations.
- **Prompting Techniques**: Zero-shot, one-shot, multi-shot, dynamic, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.
- **Evaluation**: Automated pipeline with 5+ test cases to ensure relevance and coherence.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and traffic with Chroma and cloud-ready design.

## Usage
1. Launch the Streamlit UI.
2. Enter preferences (e.g., "workout rock playlist").
3. View JSON playlist (`playlist_name`, `songs`, `description`).
4. Refine by mood, genre, or occasion.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Python, LangChain (RAG), OpenAI API (LLM), Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), Chroma (vector DB), Streamlit (UI).
- **Dataset**: Kaggle’s Spotify dataset (title, artist, genre, lyrics).
- **Pipeline**:
  1. Load and preprocess song metadata into text chunks.
  2. Generate embeddings with Sentence-Transformers.
  3. Index embeddings in Chroma for fast similarity search.
  4. Embed user query, retrieve top-5 songs, generate JSON playlist via LLM.
  5. Configure LLM: `temperature=0.8` (creativity), `top_p=0.9` (diversity), `top_k=50` (coherence), `stop=["</playlist>"]` (conciseness), JSON output.
  6. Use Spotify API for additional metadata via function calling.
  7. Evaluate with 5+ test cases (query, expected playlist); score relevance and coherence.
  8. Compare cosine, L2, and dot product similarities for retrieval accuracy via PRs.

## System Prompt
You are Ritmo, an AI playlist curator. Generate personalized playlists based on user preferences (mood, genre, occasion) using retrieved song metadata (title, artist, genre, lyrics). Output a JSON playlist with playlist_name, songs (5 song objects with title, artist, genre), and description. Use temperature=0.8, top_p=0.9, top_k=50. Stop at </playlist>. Output valid JSON.

## User Prompt
Create a JSON playlist for "chill jazz for studying" with 5 songs from provided metadata. Include playlist_name, songs (title, artist, genre), and description.

## RTFC Framework Explanation

Role: System defines AI as Ritmo, a playlist curator.
Task: System instructs generating playlists with metadata; user specifies "chill jazz for studying" playlist.
Format: Both require valid JSON with playlist_name, songs, description.
Constraints: 5 songs, creative parameters (temperature=0.8, etc.), stop at </playlist>, user theme-specific.

## Zero-Shot Prompting Explanation

What is Zero-Shot Prompting?Zero-shot prompting is a technique where the AI generates a response based solely on instructions without being provided prior examples or training data for the specific task. The model relies on its pre-trained knowledge and the clarity of the prompt to produce accurate outputs.

How Zero-Shot Prompting is Utilized

System Prompt: Defines Ritmo’s role and task clearly, instructing it to generate a playlist using metadata without providing example outputs. It specifies the JSON structure, song count (5), and LLM parameters (temperature=0.8, etc.) to guide the model in a zero-shot context.

User Prompt: Requests a specific playlist ("upbeat pop for a road trip") without example playlists, relying on the model’s ability to interpret the theme and metadata. The prompt’s clarity ensures the model can generate a relevant playlist from scratch.

The zero-shot approach allows Ritmo to handle diverse user inputs (e.g., any mood or genre) flexibly, leveraging the LLM’s generalization capabilities and the RAG pipeline’s metadata retrieval for accuracy.
